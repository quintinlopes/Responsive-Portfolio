                            Hello World! My name is Quintin Lopes, I'm 21, and this is the first real website I've designed from scratch for the UofT coding BootCamp. A couple things about myself, my favourite colour is coral, I love sports; mainly soccer, football, and basketball, and currently I'm a full time BTM student at Ryerson.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <p>
                            My day-to-day life consists of going to class while coding, going to the gym, and playing soccer in my freetime. On the weekends I work a bar job just to get some extra income while I'm still in school. Although I'm still unsure with what exactly I want to do in the future, I could see web devlopment as being a strong possibility!

                        <p>
                            If anyone actually read that little blurb, wow I'm impressed because I'm sure it was throughly uninteresting, and thank you for doing so. I'm only writing this last paragraph because the example website had three paragraphs so I'm just trying to fill space. :)
